 🧠 Task 5: Decision Tree & Random Forest - Heart Disease Classification

This project is part of my AI & ML Internship. The goal is to build and evaluate classification models using **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease.

 🎯 Objective

- Train a Decision Tree Classifier and visualize the tree.
- Analyze overfitting by controlling tree depth.
- Train and evaluate a Random Forest Classifier.
- Interpret feature importances using a bar chart.
- Evaluate both models using classification metrics and cross-validation.
